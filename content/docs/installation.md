## Download AutoTube 

 <download :display-extra-btn-text=false ></download>

### Mac OS

Open the AutoTube.dmg file, and drag it to your Applications folder.  
The dmg package is not signed yet, so you will not be able
to open the app at its first execution by double-clicking it. Don't worry,
 just open the application folder in the finder, right-click on the AutoTube
icon and select "open".

### Windows

As for the mac version, the code isn't, for the moment, signed, you will have a warning.
Just ignore it.

### Linux 
You just have to make the AutoTube.AppImage executable to run it.

## First launch
### Add FFmpeg
At the first launch you will need to download FFmpeg binaries:
