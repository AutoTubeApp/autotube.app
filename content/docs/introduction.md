# What is AutoTube ?

tl;dr: AutoTube allows you to easily publish yourself (ie without YouTube, Vimeo,...) your videos on internet.

Nowadays you have multiple options if you want to publish a video online:

- "Free" services like [YouTube](https://youtube.com "Youtube")
- Paid services like [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com "Vimeo")
- Platform As A Service
  like [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/stream-delivery "Cloudflare stream")

So you will ask:

## Why another option to publish my videos online ?
 
My main motivation at the beginning of this project was the poor quality of 1080p streams
on [YouTube](https://youtube.com "Youtube"). I have some videos with a lot of movements and as YT encode with a
relatively low bitrate (around 4Mbs), there is Ã  lot of compression artifacts:

By using AutoTube, **you can select the bitrate of each stream**, for example, in my case, as we have a high speed internet
access, i configure a 1080p stream with a 8Mbs bitrate and a "fallback" stream at 4Mbs, for those who have less available bandwidth.

There are others greats avantages of using AutoTube:

- You are no longer linked and captive of a platform. 
  As AutoTube works with any web server, you have a lot of choices to host your
  videos, and you can easily switch between them (for example if TOS changes...).

- You are no longer dependant of the platform rules and rights about the content you publish.
  For example, do you think it's fair that you can't use music your own for a **private** video that only you and your loved ones will see ?  

- As you can use standard web hosting plan, the cost of serving your videos is much cheaper than PAAS solutions.
  (We will put some example later in the doc)

- Your viewers don't have to support ads if you don't want to, and maybe more important:  
  **Your content will not be polluted by unappropriated ads**.  
  Keep in mind that YouTube have updated their TOS to add [the right to monetize any video](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/18/youtube-will-now-show-ads-on-all-videos-even-if-creators-dont-want-them "YouTube Will Now Show Ads On All Videos Even If Creators Donâ€™t Want Them").  
  If you are using YouTube professionally, imagine that YouTube can insert your competitor ads before your own product video...

## Ok but it's difficult to publish and host videos !

Yes... and no, thanks to AutoTube ! ðŸ˜‰

You just need online space served via HTTP (any web hosting plan, cloud instance, dedicated server, Amazon S3,...).  

Then AutoTube will do the hard part for you:

- Encoding your video to multiple streams, with different resolutions and bitrates, to generate a dynamic adaptative streaming package.
- Uploading this package, with a player, to your online space.

Take a look at the [demo](/ "AutoTube demo") on the home page 
(all the videos on the home page have been generated by AutoTube and hosted on 
[Scaleway S3](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/ "Object storage at Scaleway") 
behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ "CDN and cache for AutoTube") for CDN and cache).
